# eYSIP-2016-Exploring Wiced-Sense
This project aims at exploring different aspects of WICED Sense (SIP Module) i.e a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy device). The aspects include
understanding the wiced sense sdk inorder to program the device for user specfic application , procedure to acquire the data , saving the acquired data in a online database so that it can be accessible for distant users for processing , visualization of the sensor data on website and then creating applications using this data.

##Description:
 WICED Sense is a BLE device manufactured by Broadcom* which can provide wireless connectivity to wide range of embedded applications.
 The WICED Sense TAG is made up of the BCM20737S Bluetooth Low Energy SoC and five ST Microelectronics sensors: gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer , pressure, humidity and temperature. The BCM20737S connects directly to the sensors without the need for an external microprocessor.(* 5 July,2016 onwards Broadcomâ€™s IoT business is acquired by Cypress.)
 
 **ST Microelectronics Devices used in the WICED Smart Kit:**
* Gyroscope (L3GD20) 
* Accelerometer (LIS3DSH) 
* Magnetometer (LSM303D) 
* Pressure sensor (LPS25H) 
* Humidity and Temperature sensor (HTS221)
